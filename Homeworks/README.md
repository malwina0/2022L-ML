### HW 1
Exploratory data analysis & data visualisation of credit data.

### HW 2
Data preprocessing: 

* handling missing data, 
* transforming continuous variables into categorical ones, 
* coding of categorical variables,
* preliminary models.

The dataset describes transactions recorded on allegro.co.uk during one full day on 3/04/2016. The variable we predict: price.

### HW 3
Validation of models made by another team. The task was to preprocess the data and train 3 classification models (*Random Forest*, *XGBoost*, *Decision Tree*) using bankruptcy data from the Taiwan Economic Journal.

### HW 4
Adjusting hyperparameters for models (*Decission Tree*, *Random Forest*, *Support Vector Machine*) using grid search and random search methods. Comparison of the models.

### HW 5
Validation of models made by another team. The task was to test several clustering methods (*KMeans*, *agglomerative clustering*, *K-medoids*, *DBSCAN*) and select the optimal number of clusters using the elbow and silhouette methods and Daviesâ€“Bouldin index.

### HW 6
Validation of models made by another team. The task was to make Principal Component Analysis, present eigenvectors and eigenvalues on biplot diagram and selectig  the appropriate number of components.
